# Good Day!
Well, you found me.  There isn't a lot of excitment here right now but I hope to create more public repos as my interests vary and time allots.

Most of my available free time for side projects is keeping up with my local f3 tech needs, tinkering on the website and collecting big data.  While the latter project is a little long in the tooth, I have visions of rewriting that in pieces to align to more of a micro-architecture.  Some of it is limited to my hosting environment but if I feel like shelling out a few more bucks, I may rewrite as cloud native functions.  Only time will tell!
